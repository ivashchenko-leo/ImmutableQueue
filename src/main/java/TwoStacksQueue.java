/**
 * This is not my implementation but I want to mention it as it's better than mine.
 *
 * You can look at it here https://github.com/asif31iqbal/ImmutableQueue
 * Complexity for enQueue, head, isEmpty is O(1) and deQueue is O(1)/O(n).
 * It's based on two stacks which is pretty smart idea.
 *
 * I don't want to put the code here as it's not mine. But if this task was a real task, I would use this implementation.
